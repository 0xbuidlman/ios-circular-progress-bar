Add all files from the src folder to your project

## Setup

MCPercentageDoughnutView can be added to your view either from the Interface Builder or through code.

#### Interface Builder (Xcode 5):

* Open the Storyboard or Xib file you want to add the pie chart to.
* Drag a new UIView from the Object Library into your view controller.
* Resize and position your new UIView as you wish (the pie chart will be drawn on the center of the new UIView).
* Make sure the new UIView is selected and choose the Identity Inspector tab on Xcode's the Utilities view (on the right).
* Change the class from UIView to MCPercentageDoughnutView.
* On the view controller's header file create an IBOutlet property of the type MCPercentageDoughnutView and link it to the object you created on the Interface Builder.

#### Through Code:
```
CGRect frame = CGRectMake(x, y, width, height);
MCPercentageDoughnutView *percentageDoughnut = [[MCPercentageDoughnutView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
[self.view addSubview:percentageDoughnut];
```

## Example Usage
```
self.percentageDoughnut.dataSource = self;
self.percentageDoughnut.linePercentage = 0.02;
self.percentageDoughnut.percentage = 0.5;
self.percentageDoughnut.animatesBegining = NO;
```
